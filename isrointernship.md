# 🚀 ISRO Internship Application Guide

> **⚠️ Note:** Processes and eligibility can vary by **ISRO centre/unit** (NRSC, VSSC, URSC, SAC, IIRS, LPSC/IPRC, etc.) and may change over time. Always verify the latest instructions on the official site of the centre you’re applying to.

---

## 🛰️ What you’re applying for
ISRO internships are usually handled **centre-wise**.  
Your best odds come from matching your **domain + timeline + documents** to what the centre expects.

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Quick checklist (before you email)
- [ ] I’ve picked the **centre** (e.g., NRSC) and a **domain** they work on
- [ ] I meet the basic academic criteria mentioned by that centre (CGPA/%)
- [ ] I have fixed internship dates (start–end)
- [ ] I can commit full-time (or have clear availability)
- [ ] All documents are merged/cleanly named PDFs

---

## 📋 Phase 1: Prepare your documents (clean + professional)
Keep documents PDF-only and readable. Typical attachments requested by many centres:

### Required (commonly asked)
1. **Resume/CV**
2. **Bonafide / NOC / Recommendation Letter** (from College/HoD/Principal)  
   - Must mention **internship dates**
3. **Academic proofs**
   - 10th marksheet
   - 12th marksheet
   - Latest semester transcript / consolidated marksheet

### Suggested file naming
`YourName_CV.pdf`  
`YourName_LORorNOC.pdf`  
`YourName_10th.pdf`  
`YourName_12th.pdf`  
`YourName_Transcript.pdf`

**✅ Tip:** Avoid sending 10+ random files. Keep it minimal and named properly.

---

## 📨 Phase 2: Apply (Email method — NRSC example)

If you are applying to **NRSC**, a commonly used student-handling email is:

- `student@nrsc.gov.in`

### Email rules (important)
- Send **one** good email (no spamming)
- Use a **clear subject line** with your dates
- Keep the email short, specific, and readable
- Mention your domain fit in **1–2 lines**

---

## ⏳ Phase 3: After sending the email (what to expect)

Depending on centre/availability:
- You may get a reply in days to weeks
- Some teams may schedule a short call/interview
- Many decisions depend heavily on **guide availability** and **seat limits**

### If no response
- Follow up **once** after ~10–14 days (polite + short)

---

## 🧠 How to improve selection chances (practical)

Highlight projects aligned with the centre’s work:
- Remote sensing / GIS basics (if NRSC/IIRS/SAC)
- Python for data + automation
- Computer vision / image processing (e.g., segmentation/classification)
- ML fundamentals (evaluation, data pipelines)
- Link to GitHub/portfolio (clean README + results)

**✅ Best resume signal:** **1–2 projects with a measurable outcome** (e.g., accuracy, speedup, dataset size, demo link).
